webdev-candidate-project
======

This project is designed as a quick exercise to gauge a candidate's
understanding of object oriented programming, web services, and general
php/programming knowledge.

You can begin with the 'index.php' file which includes additional
information and instructions for the rest of the project.

Build this project out in the most appropriate way you see fit. Treat
it as a real-world component being added to our system. Feel free to
restructure/enhance the project as you see fit. But please keep the core
layers of abstraction in the process (DAOs, Models and Views).

If you have questions or need clarification on the project please feel
free to send an email to your recruiting contact and they will be happy
to assist you.
